# MLforSPE
Code to accompany the research paper "Machine Learning Approach to the Assessment and Prediction of Solid Particle Erosion of Metals" by authors S. Brown, F. Khomh, M. Cavarroc-Weimer, M. Mendez, L. Martinu and J.E. Klemberg-Sapieha.

The notebook MLforSPE contains code to reproduce all results in the article. CSV files for the complete database as well as the ASTM G76 predictions are included. The source list for the complete database is available in the file "Erosion_of_metals_source_list.csv"

The complete database is compiled from individual databases on erosion conditions, target material properties, and particle material properties, each of which contain further information about the provenance of data (i.e. where each material property was collected from). These individual databases are available upon request.

For confidentiality reasons, the public database does not contain internal tests performed at MDS Coating Technologies
